# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Welcome to the Southwest Airlines Open-Source FAQ. In this document, we address common questions about our initiative, goals, and expectations for our projects.

## What is the purpose of the Southwest Airlines Open-Source Initiative?

The primary purpose of our open-source initiative is to build a community around sharing code and projects, both within and outside our organization. We are committed to submitting and maintaining high-quality projects that we use and test internally in various innovative ways. For each project we release, we aim to provide not only the code but also the context and story behind it. We believe that understanding the background and purpose of a project is just as important as the code itself.

## What are the secondary goals for the Open-Source Initiative?

### Recruitment

Our open-source projects showcase the technical expertise and innovation at Southwest Airlines. By sharing our work, we aim to attract talented individuals who share our values and passion for technology.

### Public Relations

By demonstrating our commitment to open source and the projects we create, we generate PR opportunities that highlight the capabilities of Southwest Technology and our contributions to the broader tech community.

### Internal Morale

Our open source initiative fosters a culture of collaboration and learning among our team members (aka our co-hearts), promoting personal and professional growth while boosting morale within the organization.

### Yearly Hackathon

We host a yearly internal hackathon to encourage innovation and creativity within our team. Our open-source projects provide a platform for participants to build upon, learn from, and share their ideas.

### Open Source Community

By actively participating in the open-source community, we aim to contribute to the collective knowledge, learn from others, and help improve the software ecosystem as a whole.
